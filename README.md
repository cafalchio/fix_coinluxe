## Design

### Colour Scheme

The palette was was choose o create a clean and simple design for the CoinLuxe website. 

Clean and Minimalistic: White is often associated with cleanliness and  minimalism. It creates a sense of spaciousness and helps to accentuate  other elements on the website. By incorporating white into the design,  the CoinLuxe website achieves a clean and uncluttered appearance.

Timeless Elegance: Black is a classic color that exudes sophistication  and elegance. It adds depth and contrast to the overall design, making  important elements or text stand out. The use of black in the color  palette enhances the website's visual appeal and provides a sense of  refinement.

### Images

The CoinLuxe website incorporates crypto images and crypto data obtained from Coingecko.com through the Coingecko API. To ensure real-time and  accurate information, the crypto data is updated every 10 minutes using a scheduler configured on the Heroku platform.

### Fonts

The fonts used in this project are system fonts

### Wireframes

The wireframes for this project were created using [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/). The wireframes were created to provide a visual representation of the website's layout and functionality.

# Agile Methodology

Github projects was used to manage the project's tasks and issues. 

The link to the project's Github project board can be found [here](https://github.com/users/cafalchio/projects/7)

# Database Schema

PostgreSQL was used to create the database for this project. The database schema can be found below:



# Security

## User Authentication

Authentication was implemented using Django's built-in authentication system. The authentication system was used to create a custom user model that allows users to sign up and log in to the website. The authentication system was also used to create a custom admin model that allows admin users to log in to the admin site.

Decorators were used to restrict access to certain pages based on the user's role. The decorators used in this project are:

- @login_required: restricts access to the page to logged in users.
- @staff_member_required: restricts access to the page to admin users.

## Form Validation

For security purposes, form validation was implemented in the following forms:

- Login form
- Signup form

## Custom error pages:

Custom error pages were created for the following errors:

- 404 - (page not found): Page not found error occurs when the user tries to access a page that does not exist.

  This functionality ensures that the user is redirected to a custom error page when an error occurs.

# Deployment

To deploy this page to Heroku from its GitHub repository, the following steps were taken:

## Create the Heroku App:
- Log in to [Heroku](https://dashboard.heroku.com/apps) or create an account.
- On the main page click the button labelled New in the top right corner and from the drop-down menu select "Create New App".
- Enter a unique and meaningful app name.
- Next, select your region.
- Click on the Create App button.

## Attach the Postgres database:
- In the Resources tab, under add-ons, type in Postgres and select the Heroku Postgres option.
- Copy the DATABASE_URL located in Config Vars in the Settings Tab.
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install dj_databse_url`
    - `pip3 install psycopg2-binary` 
- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Add the DATABASE_URL value and your chosen SECRET_KEY value to the env.py file. 
- In settings.py file import dj_database_url, comment out the default configurations within database settings and add the following: 

```
DATABASES = {
    'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
}
```
- Run migrations and create a superuser for the new database. 
- Create an if statement in settings.py to run the postgres database when using the app on heroku or sqlite if not

```
    if 'DATABASE_URL' in os.environ:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': dj_database_url.parse(os.environ.get('DATABASE_URL'))
        }
    else:
        DATABASES = {
            'default': {
                'ENGINE': 'django.db.backends.sqlite3',
                'NAME': BASE_DIR / 'db.sqlite3',
            }
    }
```

- Create requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`
- Create a file named "Procfile" in the main directory and add the following: `web: gunicorn project-name.wsgi:application`
- Add Heroku to the ALLOWED_HOSTS list in settings.py in the format ['app_name.heroku.com', 'localhost']

- Push these changes to Github.

## Update Heroku Config Vars
Add the following Config Vars in Heroku:

## Connecting S3 to Django 
- Go back to your IDE and install 2 more requirements:
    - `pip3 install boto3`
    - `pip3 install django-storages` 
- Update your requirements.txt file by typing `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt` and add storages to your installed apps.
- Create an if statement in settings.py 

```
if 'USE_AWS' in os.environ:
    AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME = 'insert-your-bucket-name-here'
    AWS_S3_REGION_NAME = 'insert-your-region-here'
    AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID = os.environ.get('AWS_ACCESS_KEY_ID')
    AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY = os.environ.get('AWS_SECRET_ACCESS_KEY')

```
- Then add the line 

    - `AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN = f'{AWS_STORAGE_BUCKET_NAME}.s3.amazonaws.com'` to tell django where our static files will be coming from in production.


- Create a file called custom storages and import both our settings from django.con as well as the s3boto3 storage class from django storages. 
- Create the following classes:

```
class StaticStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.STATICFILES_LOCATION

class MediaStorage(S3Boto3Storage):
    location = settings.MEDIAFILES_LOCATION
```

- In settings.py add the following inside the if statement:

```
STATICFILES_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.StaticStorage'
STATICFILES_LOCATION = 'static'
DEFAULT_FILE_STORAGE = 'custom_storages.MediaStorage'
MEDIAFILES_LOCATION = 'media'
STATIC_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{STATICFILES_LOCATION}/'
MEDIA_URL = f'https://{AWS_S3_CUSTOM_DOMAIN}/{MEDIAFILES_LOCATION}/'

```

- and then add the following at the top of the if statement:
```
AWS_S3_OBJECT_PARAMETERS = {
    'Expires': 'Thu, 31 Dec 2099 20:00:00 GMT',
    'CacheControl': 'max-age=94608000',
}
```

- Go to S3, go to your bucket and click 'Create folder'. Name the folder 'media' and click 'Save'.
- Inside the folder, click 'Upload', 'Add files', and then select all the images that you are using for your site.
- Then under 'Permissions' select the option 'Grant public-read access' and click upload.
- Your static files and media files should be automatically linked from django to your S3 bucket.
